# AGENTS.md

This file is for agentic coding tools working in this repo.

This repository is a Go CLI app named `no-mistakes`.
The binary entrypoint is `cmd/no-mistakes`.
Most implementation code lives under `internal/`.

**Environment**

- Go version: see `go.mod`
- Build tooling: standard Go toolchain plus `Makefile`
- CLI/UI libraries: `cobra`, `bubbletea`, `bubbles`, `lipgloss`
- Database: SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite`

Safest local verification sequence after non-trivial changes:

- `gofmt -w .`
- `make lint`
- `go test -race ./...`
- `make e2e` when touching agent integrations, the e2e harness, or recorded fixtures
- `go build -o ./bin/no-mistakes ./cmd/no-mistakes`

**Project Layout**

- `cmd/no-mistakes`: process entrypoint
- `internal/cli`: cobra commands and CLI wiring
- `internal/daemon`: background daemon and run management
- `internal/pipeline` and `internal/pipeline/steps`: orchestration plus review/test/lint/push/PR/CI steps
- `internal/agent`: Claude, Codex, Rovo Dev, OpenCode, Pi, Copilot, and ACP/acpx integrations
- `internal/git`, `internal/ipc`, `internal/config`, `internal/db`, `internal/paths`, `internal/types`: shared infrastructure
- `internal/tui`: terminal UI

**Fork Routing**

- `repos.upstream_url` is the parent repository used for PR base routing.
- `repos.fork_url` is an optional GitHub fork push target.
- `no-mistakes init --fork-url <url>` expects `origin` to point at the GitHub parent repository and `<url>` to point at the contributor fork.
- Plain `no-mistakes init` preserves an existing fork URL on idempotent refresh.
- Push code must use `Repo.PushURL()` so configured forks receive branch updates.
- GitHub PR code must keep `--repo` pointed at the parent and use `--head <fork_owner>:<branch>` when `fork_url` is set.
- GitHub existing-PR lookup must not pass `<owner>:<branch>` to `gh pr list --head`; list by the bare branch and filter the returned head owner fields.
- GitLab and Bitbucket fork MR/PR routing is intentionally out of scope until implemented end to end.
- If a legacy or manually edited row has `fork_url` for GitLab or Bitbucket, PR creation must skip instead of opening a self PR.

**GitLab Backend (`internal/scm/gitlab`)**

- The GitLab `Host` is constructed via `gitlab.New(cmd, cliAvailable, host, projectPath)`, mirroring the GitHub backend's positional constructor. `host` is the repo's GitLab hostname (from `scm.ExtractHost(UpstreamURL)`); `projectPath` is the `group/project` path (subgroups allowed, from `gitlab.ProjectPath` - which lives in the gitlab package next to the `Host` that consumes it, mirroring `github.RepoSlug`). Both are optional; passing `"", ""` reproduces the legacy unscoped behavior used by unit tests.
- glab's flag surface drifts between versions; the backend is pinned against `glab v1.5x`. Two flags bit us: `glab auth status` must be **host-scoped** with `--hostname <host>` (unscoped, it checks every configured instance and fails if ANY has a stale token, falsely reporting an authenticated repo as unauthenticated); and `glab mr list` no longer accepts `--state opened` (open is the default; v1.5x exposes `-c/--closed`, `-M/--merged`, `-A/--all`) - passing the removed flag fails the whole command. When the host is unknown, fall back to the unscoped auth check (fail-safe).
- The daemon operates in a **detached-HEAD worktree** (it checks out the commit, not a branch). `glab ci get` refuses to run there ("you're not on any Git branch (a 'detached HEAD' state)") even with an explicit `--pipeline-id`. Read pipeline jobs via the branch-independent REST endpoint instead: `glab api projects/<url-encoded group%2Fproject>/pipelines/<id>/jobs` (`Host.pipelineJobsArgs`). The legacy `glab ci get` path is kept only as the fallback when no project path is supplied. The `glab api .../jobs` payload carries `finished_at`, mapped into `Check.CompletedAt` (needed for CI re-run detection).

**Documentation**

- Keep `README.md` concise and high-level. The bar needs to be extremely high for what has to show up there.
- Do not put technical details or deep reference material in `README.md`.
- Most documentation should live in `docs/` which is the published docs site.

**Agent-Guidance Surfaces**

- `skills/no-mistakes/SKILL.md` is **generated**, not hand-written: the source of truth is the `body` constant in `internal/skill/skill.go`. Edit the body, then `make skill` to regenerate; `make lint` runs `skill-check` (`genskill --check`) and fails CI on drift. Never edit `SKILL.md` directly. `no-mistakes init` installs/refreshes this same rendering at user level, so the strings in the Go source are what ships to agents.
- The "how an agent drives the pipeline" guidance lives in **three surfaces that must stay in sync**: (1) the skill body above (loaded when an agent invokes `/no-mistakes`); (2) the live `axi` output strings in `internal/cli/axi*.go` - the home `help` (`axi.go`), the gate `note`/`help` and run/respond return help (`axi_render.go` `gateFields`), and the `--help` Long strings (`axi_drive.go`); and (3) the published `docs/src/content/docs/guides/agents.md`. When you change driving guidance in one, mirror it in the others. The point-of-use `axi` strings are the layer an agent reads while driving without reopening the skill.
- Review auto-fix is disabled by default (`config.go` `autoFixDefaults` `Review: 0`; a repo or global `auto_fix.review > 0` override re-enables it through `AutoFixLimit(types.StepReview)` and the executor auto-fix loop), so blocking and ask-user review findings park for an agent decision rather than being silently self-fixed.
  An info-level auto-fix review finding under the default neither parks nor is fixed, so keep the skill, live `axi` note, and docs qualified if you touch review auto-fix.

**Context, Concurrency, and Processes**

- Thread `context.Context` through long-running, subprocess, and networked work.
- Prefer `exec.CommandContext` for subprocesses.
- Route every long-lived subprocess spawned on behalf of a cancellable step/agent invocation through `shellenv.ConfigureShellCommand(cmd)` after building the `*exec.Cmd`.
  It puts the child in its own process tree boundary (Unix `Setpgid`, Windows job object with `taskkill` fallback) and installs `cmd.Cancel` to kill the whole tree on context cancellation.
  Without it, `exec.CommandContext` only kills the direct child and grandchildren survive (e.g. `npm` -> `node` test workers, agent-spawned git/build/editor), keep running, and hold the worktree locked so the next run on the same branch cannot proceed.
  Applied to the step shell runner (`runShellCommandWithEnv`) and the native agent `runOnce` builders (claude, codex, pi, copilot, acpx); apply it to any new subprocess in those paths.
- `cmd.Cancel` only covers the **cancellation** half of the lifecycle.
  On a clean exit (exit 0) or an error return it never fires, so a grandchild that outlived the leader - a test runner's worker pool, a build watcher, a dev server - is **not** reaped.
  This is the agent-spawning test step's failure mode: a repo with no `commands.test` asks the agent to run the tests, the agent's worker pool leaks on every clean run, and the orphans accumulate (each a multi-hundred-MB pool) until the host is out of memory and the OS OOM-killer SIGKILLs the daemon - surfacing on the next start as `daemon crashed during execution` (no Go stack trace, because SIGKILL is uncatchable).
  Use `shellenv.RunShellCommand`, `shellenv.OutputShellCommand`, or `shellenv.CombinedOutputShellCommand` for one-shot commands; they start the command and reap the group on success/error paths too.
  When manual pipe handling is needed, use `shellenv.StartShellCommand(cmd)` and ensure `shellenv.TerminateShellCommandGroup(cmd)` runs as soon as the command is done or the parse loop fails.
  For stdout/stderr parsers that read until EOF, make the Wait owner terminate the group when the leader exits so a descendant holding inherited pipes cannot wedge the parser.
  `startNativeAgentCommand` owns that lifecycle for the native agent runners.
  Group termination is a harmless no-op (ESRCH) when nothing survived.
  `ConfigureShellCommand` also installs a `cmd.WaitDelay` pipe backstop (5s, now on unix as well as Windows) so a grandchild holding an inherited stdout/stderr pipe open after exit can't wedge `cmd.Wait`/`CombinedOutput` forever; it bounds the hang into a graceful step failure instead of taking the daemon down.
  Regressions:
  `TestCodexAgent_Run_ReapsLeakedGrandchildOnCleanExit` (agent path),
  `TestRunShellCommandWithEnv_ReapsGrandchildOnCleanExit` (configured-command path),
  `TestTerminateShellCommandGroup_*` (the primitive).
- On Windows the daemon runs console-less, so every console child it spawns (git, shell steps, native agents, provider CLIs, and helper commands such as `powershell`/`taskkill`/managed servers) would otherwise flash a fresh visible console window for its lifetime (#287).
  Route each such `*exec.Cmd` through `winproc.Harden(cmd)` after building it: it OR-s `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` into any existing creation flags (preserving e.g. `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`) and sets `HideWindow`, leaves stdout/stderr redirection intact, is safe on a nil or already-populated `SysProcAttr` and safe to call more than once, and is a no-op on non-Windows platforms.
  `shellenv.ConfigureShellCommand` already calls it, so cancellable step/agent subprocesses routed through that helper are covered; one-shot commands built directly (`git.Run`, `stepCmd`, `scm.AuthConfigured`, doctor's `git --version`, and the Windows service/taskkill/powershell/managed-server helpers) call it themselves, so apply it to any new such subprocess.
  Intentionally detached background processes already run without a window: `update`'s detached spawn OR-s `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` into its own flags directly rather than calling `Harden`.
  Regressions: `TestHarden*` in `internal/winproc`.
- Use derived contexts and timeouts for cleanup and HTTP calls.
- Use `context.Background()` mainly at top-level boundaries, background tasks, or in tests.
- Protect shared mutable state with `sync.Mutex`, `sync.RWMutex`, `sync.Map`, or `atomic` where appropriate.
- Be explicit about ownership and cleanup of goroutines, worktrees, temp dirs, and channels.

**Filesystem and Paths**

- Use `filepath.Join` and related helpers.
- Respect `NM_HOME` when working with app state.
- Tests should isolate filesystem state with `t.TempDir()` and `t.Setenv("NM_HOME", ...)`.
- Existing code typically uses `0o755` for directories and `0o644` for files such as logs.
- On macOS, remember that path comparisons may need symlink resolution like `/var` vs `/private/var`.

**Git on Bare Gate Repos (`safe.bareRepository`)**

- Agent harnesses (e.g. Claude Code) and hardened CI inject `safe.bareRepository=explicit` via `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`/`GIT_CONFIG_KEY_n`/`GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_n`, which forbids cwd-based discovery of bare repositories. Every git operation on a gate repo must therefore name it explicitly: `git.Run` detects a bare git dir (`isBareGitDir`: `HEAD` file + `objects/` dir, no `.git` entry) and prepends `--git-dir=<dir>`; working trees and linked worktrees keep normal discovery. Route gate git calls through `git.Run` - never shell out to git in a bare gate repo relying only on `cmd.Dir` or `-C` discovery (issue #362). Regressions: `TestRunOnBareRepoUnderSafeBareRepositoryExplicit`, `TestWorktreeAddRemoveOnBareRepoUnderSafeBareRepositoryExplicit`, `TestInitUnderSafeBareRepositoryExplicit`.

**Post-Receive Hook Gate Path Resolution (`internal/git/hook.go`)**

- The hook's `--gate` value must never come from a bare `$(pwd)`: Git can invoke `post-receive` from a cwd whose `pwd` collapses to `.` (issue #269), which the daemon rejects (`"invalid gate path: ."`) and the pipeline silently never starts - `git push` reports success with no hint. `GATE_DIR` is resolved in order: `git rev-parse --absolute-git-dir` (queries git directly, ignores `$PWD`) first; if that fails or yields a relative path, fall back to `cd`-ing to the parent of the hook script's own location (`$0`) and reading `pwd -P`; a final `pwd -P` is the last-resort guard. `daemon notify-push --gate` (`internal/cli/daemon_cmd.go` `normalizeNotifyGatePath`) is a second, independent layer that `filepath.Abs`+`Clean`s whatever gate path it is given, so an already-installed older managed hook that still emits a relative path keeps working after a CLI upgrade without needing the hook file itself reinstalled.
- Regressions: `TestPostReceiveHook_ResolvesAbsoluteGateDir`, `TestPostReceiveHook_FallsBackToHookLocationForGateDir` (`internal/git/hook_test.go`), `TestNormalizeNotifyGatePathResolvesLegacyDotGate` (`internal/cli/daemon_cmd_test.go`).

**Daemon Singleton Lock (`internal/daemon/lock.go`)**

- Only one live daemon process may own an `NM_HOME` at a time. Before v1.33.x this was unenforced: `internal/ipc/transport_unix.go` `listen()` unconditionally `os.Remove`d the Unix socket before binding, so a second daemon starting against the same root silently stole the socket path from a still-live first daemon instead of failing. The stolen-from daemon stayed alive but became unreachable, while every subsequent daemon startup ran **global** stale-run recovery (`RecoverStaleRuns`) and orphan-worktree cleanup against the shared DB/worktree root - marking the still-running daemon's active runs `daemon crashed during execution` and deleting worktrees out from under pipelines that were still executing in them (`chdir .../worktrees/...: no such file or directory`).
- The fix is an OS-level advisory file lock at `p.LockFile()` (`<NM_HOME>/daemon.lock`, distinct from the informational `daemon.pid`). `acquireSingletonLock` (Unix: `syscall.Flock(LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)`; Windows: `windows.LockFileEx` with `LOCKFILE_FAIL_IMMEDIATELY`) is taken as the very first action inside `RunWithOptions` - shared by every entrypoint (`daemon.Run()` for `daemon start`'s detached child and for direct `no-mistakes daemon run --root`, plus `RunWithResources`/`RunWithOptions` used by tests) - strictly before `recoverOnStartup` and before the IPC socket binds, and held for the process lifetime via `defer lock.Release()`. A failed acquire returns `ErrSingletonLockHeld` and the daemon does not start.
- No separate "is the holder still alive" staleness check is needed the way the PID file requires one: `flock`/`LockFileEx` are held per open file description, and the kernel releases them automatically when every fd referencing that description closes, including on process exit or SIGKILL. A held lock therefore always means a genuinely live holder - this is what makes the guard safe by construction rather than needing pid+start-time heuristics.
- `internal/ipc/transport_unix.go` `listen()` is a second, independent layer: before removing the socket path it now dials it (`net.DialTimeout("unix", endpoint, 200ms)`); if something answers, it fails instead of unlinking a live daemon's socket. Only a proven-stale path (nothing listening - a leftover from an unclean exit) is removed and rebound. This keeps `listen()` itself safe even if called outside the daemon package's lock.
- Daemon execution is explicit-only: only `no-mistakes daemon run --root <NM_HOME>` may enter `daemon.Run()`. Never use inherited environment such as `NM_DAEMON=1` to reinterpret probes (`--version`, `daemon status`, `status`) as daemon workers; dead or silent sockets must fail fast instead of starting embedded fallback daemons.
- Startup worktree cleanup (`cleanupOrphanWorktrees`, split out of `recoverOnStartup`) is DB-aware: `skipWorktreeCleanup` looks up each worktree's run row and never removes one whose status is `pending` or `running`, only terminal-run leftovers or directories with no matching run row. `RunManager.startRun` always inserts the run row before creating the worktree directory, so a "no matching run" directory is never one whose insert simply hasn't landed yet on a single daemon - it's safe to remove immediately (no grace period; one was tried and it broke `TestRecoverCleansUpOrphanedWorktrees`, which expects immediate removal of a directory with no DB row at all).
- A third layer guards the client side: `EnsureDaemon`'s liveness probe (`daemonIsRunningViaIPC` in `internal/daemon/selfexec.go`) dials through `ipc.Dial`, which bounds the attempt with `daemon_connect_timeout` (config field, default `3s`; env `NM_DAEMON_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, see `internal/ipc/client.go`). A `*ipc.ConnectTimeoutError` means the socket exists and the process is alive but stuck, not stale, so the probe propagates that error instead of reporting not-alive, and `EnsureDaemon` returns it instead of falling through to `Start` a second daemon against the same root. A dial failure against a socket path that no longer exists still reports not-alive so `Start` can proceed normally, but a dial failure against a socket path that _does_ exist (e.g. nothing listening - a dead socket left by an unclean exit) now also fails fast with a `connect to daemon socket` error instead of silently treating it as not-alive: `Start()` itself still discards this error and self-heals (it re-probes, reconciles colliding daemons, and starts fresh), but `EnsureDaemon` callers (`no-mistakes`, `init`, `attach`, `rerun`, `axi run`/`respond`) surface it directly, and `EnsureDaemon` itself appends a `(run 'no-mistakes daemon start' to recover)` hint to whatever `daemonHealthCheck` returned so the error text is self-explanatory without cross-referencing this doc. Run `no-mistakes daemon start` (or `daemon stop` then `daemon start`) to recover. Once dialed, the health-check RPC round trip itself (`client.CallWithTimeout(ipc.MethodHealth, ...)`) is bounded separately by the fixed, non-configurable `ipc.DefaultDialTimeout` (250ms) rather than `daemon_connect_timeout` - a connected-but-wedged daemon that accepts the socket yet never answers the health RPC still fails fast.
- Regressions: `TestAcquireSingletonLock_SecondAcquireFails`/`_ReleaseAllowsReacquire`/`_ReportsExistingHolder` (lock mechanics), `TestRunWithResources_SecondDaemonForSameRootFailsWithoutStealingSocket` (end-to-end duplicate-daemon repro, asserts the first daemon stays reachable), `TestRunWithOptions_RequiresSingletonLockBeforeRecovery` (lock gates `RecoverStaleRuns`), `TestRecoverOnStartup_DoesNotDeleteActiveRunWorktree` (active-run worktree survives `cleanupOrphanWorktrees`), `TestServe_SecondListenerForLiveSocketDoesNotStealIt` (`internal/ipc`, socket-steal repro at the transport layer), `TestDialConnectTimeoutFailsFastAndNamesSocket` (bounded client dial), `TestLoadGlobal_InvalidDaemonConnectTimeout` (config validation), `TestIsRunningFailsFastWhenSocketAcceptsButDoesNotRespond`/`TestIsRunningSurfacesExistingDeadSocket` (dead/silent socket fail-fast), `TestDaemonRunRootFromArgs_EnvDoesNotForceDaemonModeForProbes` (explicit-only daemon execution), `TestValidateDaemonPIDFallback_RefusesToKillOwnProcess`/`TestWaitForDaemonStopNeverKillsOwnPIDWhenHealthCheckOnlyErrors` (PID-kill fallback never targets the caller's own process).

**Destructive Daemon Lifecycle Guard (`internal/lifecycle/guard.go`)**

- `no-mistakes daemon stop`, `no-mistakes daemon restart`, and `no-mistakes update` all share a daemon-owned by a whole machine, not just one repo, so stopping/replacing it mid-run can fail every pipeline currently active across every repo on that `NM_HOME`. All three refuse by default when `lifecycle.ActiveRuns(p)` (pending/running rows in the local state DB) is non-empty, print each active run's ID, status, branch, and short head SHA via `lifecycle.RunList`, and require an explicit `--force` flag to proceed anyway. `guardDestructiveDaemonLifecycle` (`internal/cli/daemon_cmd.go`) implements the `daemon stop`/`daemon restart` check; `updater.confirmActiveRunsBeforeUpdate` (`internal/update/active_runs.go`) implements it for `update`, sharing the same `lifecycle.ActiveRuns`/`lifecycle.RunList` helpers so the three commands report runs identically.
- `-y`/`--yes` on `update` does **not** bypass this guard - it only answers the separate "daemon running from a different executable path" prompt. Only `--force` accepts the risk of active runs failing. This is a deliberate split: `-y` was previously overloaded to also skip the active-run warning, which made it too easy for a scripted/agent-driven `update -y` to silently kill in-flight pipelines.
- Every invocation of `daemon stop`, `daemon restart`, or `update` - forced or not, guard-triggered or not - is logged via `logLifecycleInvocation` (`internal/cli/lifecycle_log.go`) to `<NM_HOME>/logs/cli.log` with the command name, `force` value, the caller's PID and PPID, and the parent process's command line (`ps -o command= -p <ppid>`, best-effort, empty on failure). This is the forensic trail for "which agent or process stopped/restarted the shared daemon" after an incident; do not remove or weaken it when touching these commands.
- Regressions: `TestDaemonStopRefusesWithActiveRunsAndListsThem`, `TestDaemonStopForceOverridesActiveRunGuard`, `TestDaemonRestartRefusesWithActiveRuns`, `TestLifecycleCommandsWriteCallerAttributionToCLILog` (`internal/cli/daemon_lifecycle_test.go`); `TestUpdaterRunRefusesWithActiveRunsAndListsThem`, `TestUpdaterActiveRunGuardAllowsForce` (`internal/update/update_test.go`).

**Testing Conventions**

- Tests live next to the code in `*_test.go` files.
- Use the standard `testing` package.
- Table-driven tests are common and use `tests := []struct { ... }` plus `t.Run`.
- Use `t.Helper()` in helpers.
- Use `t.TempDir()` for isolated filesystem state.
- Use `t.Setenv()` for environment-dependent behavior.
- Prefer creating real git repos in temp directories instead of relying on heavy mocking.
- Packages whose tests shell out to git unset `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` in `TestMain` so ambient `GIT_CONFIG_*` injection from agent harnesses cannot leak into tests; a test that exercises the injected config re-sets it with `t.Setenv` (see `internal/git`, `internal/gate`, `internal/daemon`, `internal/pipeline/steps`). Follow the same pattern in new git-spawning test packages.
- Packages whose tests can start a daemon or otherwise touch ambient `no-mistakes` state (`cmd/no-mistakes`, `internal/cli`, `internal/update`) set a package-wide `TestMain` that points `NM_HOME` and `HOME` at fresh `os.MkdirTemp` directories for the whole run, disables telemetry/update-check env vars, and removes both dirs on exit; individual tests then layer `t.TempDir()`/`t.Setenv()` on top as usual. This keeps a real developer's or agent's `~/.no-mistakes` (state, `cli.log`, live daemon) untouched by a full test run. Follow the same pattern in new packages whose tests can spawn a daemon or write CLI logs.
- CLI tests often capture output and assert with `strings.Contains`.
- Prefer e2e tests, new or existing, for behavior that crosses a process or I/O boundary: CLI flags, config loading, git operations, agent spawning, daemon/process coordination, stdout/stderr, and recorded fixtures.
- Unit-test pure helpers and tightly scoped package behavior where speed and failure localization are worth more than full-product realism.
- Prefer targeted package tests while iterating, then finish with `go test -race ./...` and `make e2e` when your change affects those process or I/O boundaries.
- The e2e suite lives behind the `e2e` build tag, so it is excluded from `go test ./...` and runs separately in CI via `make e2e`.
- `make e2e` sweeps both `./internal/e2e/...` (full journey suite) and `./internal/pipeline/steps/...`, so step-local e2e tests (e.g. `internal/pipeline/steps/*_e2e_test.go`, gated by `//go:build e2e`) are also covered. Keep new step-local e2e tests behind the `e2e` tag so `go test ./...` still skips them.

**Repo Config Trust Boundary (security)**

- The daemon runs `commands.*` from `.no-mistakes.yaml` verbatim via `sh -c`, and `agent` selects which process launches (incl. `acp:` targets) with the maintainer's credentials. To prevent supply-chain RCE, the **code-executing selection fields (`commands.{test,lint,format}` and `agent`)** are loaded from the trusted default branch, never from the pushed SHA. See `internal/daemon/manager.go` `startRun` + `loadTrustedRepoConfig`, and `config.EffectiveRepoConfig`.
- `startRun` fetches the default branch, resolves it to an exact commit SHA (`git.ResolveRef`), and `loadTrustedRepoConfig` reads `.no-mistakes.yaml` at that **pinned SHA** (not the `origin/<defaultBranch>` ref name). On fetch failure (or if the ref does not resolve) the trusted SHA is empty → `loadTrustedRepoConfig` returns nil → `EffectiveRepoConfig` forces empty `commands`/`agent`. This fails closed: a stale `origin/<default>` ref left in the shared bare repo by a previous run cannot serve a value the live default branch removed. Regression tests: `TestLoadTrustedRepoConfig_FailClosedOnFetchFailure`, `TestLoadTrustedRepoConfig_PinnedSHAReadsFreshDefaultBranch`.
- Non-executing fields (`ignore_patterns`, `auto_fix`, `intent`, `test`) are still read from the pushed branch.
- `document.instructions` (the repo's documentation placement policy, injected into the document gate prompt) is also trusted-only like `commands`/`agent`: a pushed branch must not weaken the documentation rules that gate its own review. Regression: `TestEffectiveRepoConfig_DocumentPolicyTrustedOnly`.
- `allow_repo_commands` is **per-repo, read from the trusted default-branch copy of `.no-mistakes.yaml`** (declared on `RepoConfig`), never the global config and never the pushed SHA. It defaults `false`; when `true` the maintainer has opted in to honoring the pushed branch's `commands` and `agent` wholesale. A contributor cannot self-enable it from a pushed branch. When changing this logic, keep `commands`/`agent` locked to the default branch and update the e2e test `TestRepoConfigCommandsFromDefaultBranch` (incl. the `pushed_branch_cannot_self_enable` subtest).
- The e2e harness models a trusted single-developer environment, so it commits `allow_repo_commands: true` to the default-branch `.no-mistakes.yaml` via `SetupOpts.AllowRepoCommands`; security tests pass `false` to exercise the secure default.

**CI Monitor Lifecycle**

- The CI step (`internal/pipeline/steps/ci.go`) babysits an open PR until it is merged, closed, the run is cancelled, or `ci_timeout` elapses. It auto-fixes failing checks and rebases on merge conflicts via `autoFixCI`.
- `ci_timeout` is an **idle timeout, not an absolute deadline**: it re-arms (`timeoutAnchor = now()`) every time the upstream default-branch tip advances, so an actively-rebased green PR keeps its monitor no matter how long it stays open. `started` stays fixed for poll-interval/grace-period pacing; only `timeoutAnchor` moves. Re-arm only ever extends the deadline, so a transient base-tip resolution failure is fail-safe. `baseBranchTip` is injectable for tests.
- `config.CITimeout` semantics: `>0` finite, `0` = unset (step falls back to `config.DefaultCITimeout`, 7 days), `<0` = `config.CITimeoutUnlimited` (never self-terminate). Config keyword `ci_timeout: "unlimited"` (also `none`/`off`/`never`) or any non-positive duration resolves to the unlimited sentinel via `parseCITimeout`. Keep `config.DefaultCITimeout` and the `defaultConfigYAML` `ci_timeout` value in sync (`TestDefaultConfigYAML_MatchesGoDefaults`).
- Reap a run by id from outside its worktree with `no-mistakes axi abort --run <id>` (`runAxiAbortByRunID`). It needs only `NM_HOME` + the daemon, not a repo/branch/worktree, because `ipc.MethodCancelRun` → `RunManager.HandleCancel` only cancels runs live in daemon memory. An unknown/inactive id, or a stopped daemon, is an idempotent no-op (`aborted: false`), not an error. This is how an orphaned monitor (worktree torn down before merge) gets reaped deterministically. Bare `axi abort` (no `--run`) stays worktree/branch-scoped.

**Parked / Awaiting-Agent Signal**

- A run carries a pollable "parked, awaiting the driving agent" marker so a supervisor can tell in one `axi status` read whether a run is waiting for the agent to drive a gate versus actively running/fixing/ci. It is **observability only**: it does not change gate resolution, auto-resume, or the `--yes` default.
- Storage: `runs.awaiting_agent_since` (unix seconds, nullable) on `db.Run.AwaitingAgentSince`. `ipc.RunInfo` exposes both `AwaitingAgent bool` (= since != nil) and `AwaitingAgentSince *int64`; `runToInfo` derives them.
- Invariant: `awaiting_agent_since` is non-nil **iff a step is actually parked** at an `awaiting_approval`/`fix_review` gate. The executor (`internal/pipeline/executor.go`) sets it via `db.SetRunAwaitingAgent` on gate entry (right before the step status flips to the gate state, so it is already set once pollers observe the gate) and clears it via `db.ClearRunAwaitingAgent` the moment `waitForApproval` returns - covering both the agent's `axi respond` and a cancel. `RecoverStaleRuns` also clears it so a crash-recovered (failed) run is never reported as parked.
- Surface: the `run:` TOON object adds `awaiting_agent: parked <duration>` right after `status`, rendered only while `AwaitingAgentSince != nil` and the run is non-terminal (`internal/cli/axi_render.go` `runObjectFieldWithKey` + `formatParkedFor`). The render clock is the injectable `nowUnix` package var so parked-duration tests are deterministic.
- Tests: db set/clear + recovery (`internal/db/run_test.go`), executor flips-on-gate/clears-on-respond (`internal/pipeline/executor_approval_test.go`), formatter + render shape (`internal/cli/axi_test.go`), and e2e `TestAxiParkedAwaitingAgentSignal`.

**Review-Loop Agent Sessions (`internal/pipeline/sessions.go`)**

- The review loop reuses durable native agent sessions per run and per role: ONE reviewer session across the initial review and every full rereview, and a SEPARATE fixer session across review-fix turns (`RunSessions`, roles `reviewer`/`review-fixer`).
  Roles never share a session (the reviewer must never inherit the fixer's rationale), no other step uses a session, and sessions are keyed strictly by run - concurrent runs/branches/repos stay isolated.
  Every review turn is still a full adversarial review of the complete branch diff; the resumed session only carries the reviewer's own prior context.
- Adapter contract: `agent.RunOpts.Session` in, `Result.SessionID/Resumed` out, capability via the optional `agent.SessionResumer` interface + `agent.SupportsSessionResume` helper (wrappers like `lifecycleAgent`/`perfRecordingAgent` must forward it).
  claude resumes via `-p --resume <id>` (session id parsed from stream-json events); codex via `codex exec resume <id> <prompt>` (thread id from `thread.started`).
  `codex exec resume` exposes a NARROWER flag surface than `codex exec` (no `--color`, no `-s/--sandbox` as of 0.144) - the resume argv omits `--color never`, and any unsupported user extraArg simply fails the resume and falls back.
- Fail-safe rules: unsupported adapter → cold run; failed resume → drop the identity, re-run the same turn in a fresh same-role session (`SessionFallback`), never skip the review; cancelled ctx → no fallback retry; `session_reuse: false` forces everything cold.
  Persistence is minimum metadata only (run, role, agent, session id) in `run_agent_sessions` - never prompts or transcripts.
  Regressions: `internal/pipeline/sessions_test.go`, `internal/pipeline/steps/review_session_test.go` (executor-level role isolation incl. park/respond), `internal/agent/session_test.go` (argv + parsing).
- The e2e fakeagent must keep understanding both codex argv shapes; `extractCodexPrompt` handles `exec resume <id> <prompt>`.

**Combined Document+Lint Housekeeping Pass**

- When `commands.lint` is empty (agent-driven lint), the document step performs BOTH duties in one agent invocation (`housekeepingFindingsSchema` adds a per-finding `category`: documentation|lint) and stashes the lint half on `sctx.Shared` (`RunShared.SetHousekeepingLint`); the lint step consumes it (`TakeHousekeepingLint`, consume-once) instead of paying a second cold pass.
  Neither duty is ever silently dropped: document-skipped, untrusted structured output, or a lint fix round all fall back to lint's own agent pass. Configured `commands.lint` is untouched and stays a first-class deterministic gate.
  Gate split fails safe: uncategorized findings count as documentation (the stricter gate). Regressions: `internal/pipeline/steps/housekeeping_test.go` (incl. the 2→1 cold-start test `TestPipeline_DocumentPlusLintIsOneAgentInvocation`).
- The document prompt enforces a placement policy (every fact has ONE owner doc; stale duplicates become pointers, never synced copies; no AGENTS.md postmortems - keep the invariant in its owner and point at the regression test; scope limited to docs this change made stale).
  Do not reintroduce exhaustive-corpus-sweep language ("Be exhaustive", "resolve every gap"); it caused doc commits in 90/121 audited PRs. Contract test: `TestDocumentStep_PromptAppliesPlacementPolicy`.

**Telemetry Shape (source-side diet + local perf evidence)**

- Read-only surfaces (`axi` home/status/logs, `status`, `runs`) emit NO pageview and gate their `command` event through `telemetry.ReadSurfaceGate` (`internal/cli/telemetry.go` `trackReadSurface`): emit on state-fingerprint change, else at most once per 10 min, persisted at `<NM_HOME>/telemetry-gate.json` so per-poll CLI processes stay bounded. Never reintroduce the pageview+command double emit for read surfaces - `axi-status` alone was ~3M Umami rows (42% of all event rows). Mutation surfaces (`axi run/respond/abort`, run/step/fix/approval events) stay full-fidelity via `trackAxiSurface`/`trackCommand`.
- Detailed performance evidence is LOCAL-ONLY: `agent_invocations` rows (one per agent invocation: purpose, session mode cold/started/resumed/fallback, truncated session-id hash, timing, exit/failure category, tokens) written by the executor's `perfRecordingAgent` wrapper, plus `runs.parked_ms` accumulated on every gate-wait end (and folded in by `RecoverStaleRuns` on crash). Steps label invocations via `RunOpts.Purpose`. Never store prompts/outputs/diffs there (shape-guard test `TestAgentInvocations_PrivacySafeShape`) and never send run IDs, paths, session identities, or per-invocation records to Umami - the only remote perf data is three bounded counts on the terminal `run finished` event (`addRunPerformanceSummary`). Read surfaces: `no-mistakes stats --agents` / `stats --run <id>`. The local/remote split is documented in `docs/src/content/docs/reference/environment.md`.

**Rebase Base & Force-Push Safety (data-loss prevention)**

- The whole job of this tool is to not lose people's code. Two invariants protect the rebase/push path; favor failing safe (refuse the push, surface a finding) over any clever recovery.
- **Rebase base comes from the freshly-fetched authoritative remote, never local/stale state.** The rebase step (`internal/pipeline/steps/rebase.go`) fetches `origin/<default>` and `origin/<branch>` (or the fork tracking ref) and rebases onto those remote-tracking refs - never the local default branch.
- **A gated branch must not silently bundle the contributor's unpushed local-default-branch commits.** `detectBundledLocalDefaultCommits` reads the working repo's local `<default>` tip (`Repo.WorkingPath`), and when that tip is ahead of `origin/<default>` **and** is an ancestor of the branch HEAD (i.e. the branch was built on unpushed default-branch work), the step returns `NeedsApproval` + `AutoFixable=false` so a human decides instead of widening the PR. Detection is best-effort: if the local default advanced past the branch point, or the working repo can't be read, it returns nil and the run proceeds. Regression: `TestRebaseStep_DetectsUnpushedLocalDefaultBranchCommits` (#283).
- **Every force-push is lease-guarded against discarding unseen upstream commits.** All force-push sites (`PushStep` in `push.go`, CI auto-fix `pushUpdatedHeadSHA` in `ci_fix.go`) route through `resolveForcePushDecision` (`internal/pipeline/steps/forcepush.go`). It re-reads the live remote head and allows the push only when: the branch is new; the remote already equals the head; the remote still equals `lastSeenSHA` (what the run last observed); or every commit now on the remote is already incorporated **by patch-id** (`git rev-list --cherry-pick --right-only HEAD...current`), excluding history the run is knowingly rewriting (`^baseSHA`, i.e. reachable from the run base - the common amend or reverting the pipeline's own autofix). Anything else returns `forcePushWouldDiscardError` and the caller must NOT push. An out-of-band commit reaches the branch _after_ the run base, so it is never an ancestor of `baseSHA` and stays flagged.
- **`lastSeenSHA` must stay the head the run last _observed_, never the live remote tip.** The push step passes the remote-tracking ref the rebase step synced (`lastFetchedBranchTip`); the CI step passes `Run.HeadSHA`. Both callers also pass `Run.BaseSHA` for the `^baseSHA` exclusion. Critically, **the rebase step refreshes `origin/<branch>` only on a normal push, NOT on a force push** - on a force push it skips both the rebase-onto and the fetch, so the tracking ref stays the last-observed head. If it refreshed on a force push, `lastSeenSHA` would equal the live tip, the `current == lastSeenSHA` fast path would pass without the content check, and an out-of-band commit on the branch would be silently clobbered. Anchoring the lease to a SHA read from the remote _immediately before pushing_ is the original #281 bug (it always passes and protects nothing); making the rebase always-fetch the branch was the same bug re-created for the force-push path. Never reintroduce either, and never degrade to a bare `--force`/`--force-with-lease` without an explicit anchor when ls-remote/fetch fails (fail closed instead). Regressions: `TestCIStep_CommitAndPush_RefusesToClobberUnseenUpstreamCommit` (#281), `TestPushStep_RefusesToClobberAdvancedUpstreamBranch` (#305), `TestForcePushRun_RefusesToClobberOutOfBandBranchCommit` (force-push fast-path clobber), and `TestResolveForcePushDecision_*`.

**When Making Changes**

- Whenever you must bring in new dependencies, check latest documentation for knowledge, and discuss with the user.
- Always use test driven development for bug fixes and feature development.
