title: Configuration
description: Global and per-repo configuration options.
---

Configuration is optional. Without any config files, `no-mistakes` defaults to
`agent: auto`, which picks the first supported native agent available on your system,
with sensible defaults for everything else.

The goal is not to make you configure a mini CI system. The default path should
work. Config exists for the parts that genuinely vary by machine or repo:

- which agent or ordered fallback list you prefer
- which test or lint commands are the canonical ones for this repo
- where test evidence artifacts should be stored
- how aggressive the auto-fix loop should be
- how soon AXI should call an active step quiet
- whether the review loop reuses supported native agent sessions
- whether no-mistakes should infer intent from recent local agent transcripts

Config is split across two files:

| File                         | Scope                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `~/.no-mistakes/config.yaml` | Global defaults for all repos |
| `<repo>/.no-mistakes.yaml`   | Per-repo overrides            |

Set `NM_HOME` to relocate the global config directory (the global file becomes `$NM_HOME/config.yaml`).

## How to think about config

- **Global config** is for your machine-level defaults.
- **Repo config** is for codebase-specific behavior that should travel with the repo.

In practice, most teams should keep personal preferences global and repo policy
local.

## What to configure first

If you are not sure where to start, configure these in this order:

1. Set `commands.test` and `commands.lint` in repo config so the gate runs the exact commands your repo expects.
2. Override `agent` per repo only when one codebase clearly works better with a different tool or fallback order.
3. Tune `auto_fix` after you have seen how much automation you actually want.

Everything else can usually wait.

## Global config

```yaml
# ~/.no-mistakes/config.yaml

# Default agent for all repos and setup-wizard suggestions.
# "auto" picks the first available native agent on PATH.
# You can also use an ordered fallback list, for example: [codex, claude].
agent: auto # auto | claude | codex | rovodev | opencode | pi | copilot | acp:<target>

# Optional acpx path and target command overrides for agent: acp:<target>.
acpx_path: acpx
acp_registry_overrides:
  local-gemini: node /opt/mock-acp-agent.mjs

# Optional native agent binary path overrides.
agent_path_override:
  claude: /Users/you/bin/claude
  codex: /opt/homebrew/bin/codex
  rovodev: /usr/local/bin/acli
  opencode: /usr/local/bin/opencode
  pi: /usr/local/bin/pi
  copilot: /usr/local/bin/copilot

# Optional extra CLI flags per native agent.
# This is global-only.
agent_args_override:
  codex:
    - -m
    - gpt-5.4
    - -c
    - service_tier="priority"
    - -c
    - model_reasoning_effort="low"

# How long the CI step monitors an open PR (provider CI status plus GitHub/GitLab
# mergeability) with no base-branch movement before giving up. Each base-branch
# advance re-arms the timer, so an actively-updated green PR keeps its monitor.
# Use "unlimited" (or aliases "none", "off", "never", or any non-positive
# duration) to monitor until the PR is merged, closed, or aborted.
ci_timeout: "168h" # any Go duration string, or an unlimited keyword

# Maximum time a CLI client waits for an existing daemon socket to accept a
# connection before failing instead of hanging. Override per-invocation with
# NM_DAEMON_CONNECT_TIMEOUT.
daemon_connect_timeout: "3s"

# How long AXI status waits without step-log or native-agent lifecycle activity
# before marking a running/fixing step as quiet. This is observability only.
step_quiet_warning: "10m"

# Daemon log verbosity.
log_level: info # debug | info | warn | error

# Reuse supported native sessions for the review loop.
# Claude and Codex keep separate reviewer and review-fixer sessions.
session_reuse: true

# Max follow-up auto-fix attempts per step. 0 = disabled after the initial step pass.
# Document fixes are attempted during the initial document pass.
auto_fix:
  rebase: 3
  document: 3
  lint: 3
  test: 3
  review: 0
  ci: 3

# Infer the author's intent from recent local agent transcripts when not supplied directly.
intent:
  enabled: true
  threshold: 0.2
  slack_days: 3
  disabled_readers: []

# Test evidence defaults to temporary local storage.
test:
  evidence:
    store_in_repo: false
    dir: .no-mistakes/evidence
```

See [Global Config Reference](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/) for the full field listing.

Before a new validation gate starts, its effective agent configuration must resolve to a runnable native agent or ACP bridge.
If `agent: auto`, an explicit agent, or every entry in a fallback list is unavailable, the gate fails before its first pipeline step, even when `commands.test` or `commands.lint` are configured.
Run `no-mistakes doctor` to check the global runner; every run repeats the check after applying a trusted repository-level `agent` override.

## Environment variables

Bitbucket Cloud PR creation and CI monitoring use environment variables instead of a provider CLI:

- `NO_MISTAKES_BITBUCKET_EMAIL`
- `NO_MISTAKES_BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN`
- `NO_MISTAKES_BITBUCKET_API_BASE_URL` - optional API base URL override

Azure DevOps uses the `az` CLI with the `azure-devops` extension; for non-interactive auth the daemon inherits a Personal Access Token from `AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT`.

## Repo config

```yaml
# .no-mistakes.yaml (in repo root)

# Override the agent, or ordered fallback list, for this repo and its setup-wizard suggestions.
agent: codex

# Explicit commands for test/lint/format steps.
commands:
  lint: "golangci-lint run ./..."
  test: "go test -race ./..."
  format: "gofmt -w ."

# Ignore these paths during review and documentation checks.
ignore_patterns:
  - "*.generated.go"
  - "vendor/**"

# Optional documentation ownership policy, trusted from the default branch.
document:
  instructions: |
    docs/ owns detailed product guidance; README.md owns the introduction.

# Override follow-up auto-fix limits for this repo.
# Document fixes are attempted during the initial document pass.
auto_fix:
  document: 3
  lint: 5

# Optional repo-level overrides for transcript-based intent extraction.
intent:
  enabled: true

# Opt in when evidence artifacts should be committed and linked from the PR.
test:
  evidence:
    store_in_repo: true
    dir: .no-mistakes/evidence
```

See [Repo Config Reference](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/) for the full field listing.

## Precedence

- Repo `agent` overrides global `agent`, including the full ordered fallback list when one is configured.
- Global `agent: auto` resolves by checking `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `acli` for `rovodev`, `pi`, then `copilot` on `PATH`.
- ACP agents are opt-in with `agent: acp:<target>` and are not considered by `agent: auto`.
- `agent_path_override`, `agent_args_override`, `acpx_path`, and `acp_registry_overrides` are global-only fields.
- `ci_timeout`, `step_quiet_warning`, `log_level`, and `session_reuse` are global-only fields.
- For Codex-backed pipeline agents, `service_tier` controls the speed or priority lane and `model_reasoning_effort` controls reasoning depth. Set both through `agent_args_override.codex` with separate `-c` entries.
- Session-control flags for Claude and Codex are reserved in `agent_args_override` so no-mistakes can preserve reviewer/fixer role isolation; configuration rejects them instead of accepting a competing session choice.
- no-mistakes reloads global config while setting up each run. To adjust Codex behavior for the next run, edit `~/.no-mistakes/config.yaml` before starting it. For repeatable profiles such as fast or deep, use separately initialized `NM_HOME` roots; `NM_HOME` moves all no-mistakes state, not just config.
- `auto_fix` from the repo config overlays global auto_fix. Fields not set in the repo config fall through to the global default.
- `intent` from the repo config overlays global intent settings. Fields not set in the repo config fall through to the global default, except `intent.disabled_readers`, which adds to globally disabled readers.
- `test.evidence` from the repo config overlays global test evidence settings. Fields not set in the repo config fall through to the global default.
- `commands`, `ignore_patterns`, and `document.instructions` are repo-only fields. `document.instructions` is always read from the trusted default branch because it controls the documentation policy that evaluates a pushed branch.
- `ci_timeout` and `auto_fix.ci` are the canonical keys; `babysit_timeout` and `auto_fix.babysit` are still accepted as legacy aliases.
- If `commands.test` is set, the test step runs it first as the baseline; when user intent is available, the agent may still run afterward to gather evidence-oriented validation.
- If `commands.test` is empty, the agent detects and runs relevant tests itself.
- If `commands.lint` is empty, the document step runs one combined documentation-and-lint housekeeping pass, then the lint step consumes its lint result. If that pass is skipped or cannot return trustworthy structured output, the lint step runs its own agent pass.
- If `commands.format` is empty, no separate push-step formatter is run automatically.
- Configured commands are step-scoped; no-mistakes terminates child processes they leave behind when the command exits, fails, or is cancelled.

The practical implication is simple: explicit commands give you deterministic
baseline behavior, while leaving commands empty asks the agent to fill in the gap.
For tests, available user intent can also trigger an evidence-oriented agent follow-up after the baseline command succeeds.
By default, evidence stays in a temporary local directory; opt into `test.evidence.store_in_repo` when your team wants evidence artifacts committed, pushed, and linked directly from PRs.
For lint, that gap includes safe formatter and linter fixes during the combined housekeeping pass when no explicit lint command is configured.

## Ignore pattern rules

Patterns in `ignore_patterns` control which files are excluded from review and documentation checks:

| Pattern             | Match rule                                         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `*.generated.go`    | No slash - matches by basename                     |
| `vendor/**`         | Ends with `/**` - matches entire directory subtree |
| `some/path/file.go` | Contains a slash - full path glob matching         |
