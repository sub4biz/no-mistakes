// CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP is the Windows creation flag that makes the child

// process matches the given PID (the child had already exited before we could

// or a transient process-table error — are genuine kill failures that must not
// be collapsed into os.ErrProcessDone.

// defaultWaitDelay is the pipe backstop installed on Windows. taskkill /T /F
// usually reaches every descendant, but when it cannot (access denied on a
// child, or a handle inherited and still held open) a nonzero WaitDelay lets
// the exec package close inherited stdout/stderr pipes and return from Wait
// instead of blocking forever on a Read held open by a surviving grandchild.
// It is a worst-case ceiling only: in the common (successful) case the pipes
// close immediately and Wait returns without waiting.

// ConfigureShellCommand is the Windows counterpart to the unix helper. There
// are no Unix-style process groups or signals here, so cancellation runs

// spawned (test runners, agent-spawned git/build tools). Without this,
// exec.CommandContext only TerminateProcess-es the direct child and leaks the
// grandchildren, keeping the worktree locked.
//
// The cancel path distinguishes an already-gone PID (os.ErrProcessDone) from a
// real taskkill failure. On a real failure — or if taskkill itself is missing —
// it falls back to killing at least the direct child and surfaces the original
// error rather than swallowing it. A nonzero WaitDelay is installed as a pipe
// backstop. Together these keep Wait/pipe reads from hanging when a descendant
// survives a failed tree kill, which the previous "every nonzero exit is
// ErrProcessDone" mapping could cause.
